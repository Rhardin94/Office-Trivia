# The Office Trivia-Game
## Link to game found here: https://rhardin94.github.io/Trivia-Game/.
* A trivia game that offers the user a series of questions in which they have 30 seconds to choose an answer.
    * If the user chooses correctly, a congratulatory screen is displayed, then the game moves to the next question
    * If the user chooses incorrectly, a snarky screen with the correct answer is displayed, then the game moves to the next question
    * If the the user does not answer within the alloted time, another snarky screen is displayed, then the game moves to the next question
    * Finally, once the user has cycled through all the questions, a score screen is displayed that includes a button to restart the game.
